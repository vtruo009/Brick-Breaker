# Scoot-Scoot-Nook-Nook

## Introduction
This is my custom project for my CS/EE 120B - Introduction to Embedded Systems class at the University of California, Riverside. This project is called Scoot-Scoot, Nook-Nook, and it is a game similar to Space Shooters. To engineer this game, I applied the critical knowledge and skills I gained from this class, which includes the use of microcontrollers and breadboard, capturing state machines in C, and hardware configuration and troubleshooting.

## Description
When the game first starts, a main menu screen displays the title and the difficulty levels. Once a difficulty is selected, the game screen comes on, showing the "asteroids" and the player's "space ship" with a bullet on top of it. The asteroids in both levels shift at the same rate, but in easy mode the asteroid are much closer than medium mode. To win the game, player needs to move (only horizontally) and destroy all the asteroids. Once all asteroids are destroyed, a "YOU WIN!" screen will appear to indicate player's victory.
