# Scoot-Scoot-Nook-Nook

## Introduction
This is my custom project for my CS/EE 120B - Introduction to Embedded Systems class at the University of California, Riverside. This project is called Scoot-Scoot, Nook-Nook, and it is a game similar to Space Shooters. To engineer this game, I applied the critical knowledge and skills I gained from this class, which include the use of microcontrollers and breadboard, capturing state machines in C, and hardware configuration and troubleshooting.
