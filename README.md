# Scoot-Scoot-Nook-Nook

##Introduction
This is my custom project for my CS/EE 120B - Introduction to Embedded Systems at University of California, Riverside. I gained critical software and hardware knowledge of state machines, timer, C programming, microcontroller, and hardware configurations and troubleshooting. For this project, I designed and implemented a game, called Scoot-Scoot, Nook-Nook (nuke), similar to Space Shooters by applying these knowledge.
